- User Request:

The user selects the country, league, and football team of their choice on the user interface.

- Communication with the API:

The user interface sends a request to the API, including information about the chosen country, league, and team.
Database Verification:

The API checks if general information about the team (such as name, state, titles, stadium, etc.) is available in the MongoDB database.
If this information is in the database, the API retrieves it.

- Web Scraper:

The API checks if real-time data (such as recent games, upcoming game, and league position) is available in the database.
If this information is not in the database or is outdated, the API triggers the web scraper (Scrapy) to collect this real-time information but without storing it in the database.

- Formatting of Temporary Data:

The data collected by the web scraper in real-time is immediately formatted by the API but not stored in the database.
The API creates JSON objects or specific data structures based on the real-time data.

- Rendering of HTML Page:

The API uses a template engine (Jinja2) to render an HTML page with the formatted information.
The real-time data is inserted into the HTML templates, populating the page with specific reports for the selected football team.
User Display:

The generated HTML page is sent back to the front-end, which displays it to the user.
The user sees updated and complete reports of the football team on the interface.

- Request Completion:

The API concludes the request, and the temporary data collected by the web scraper is not stored in the database, ensuring it is displayed only once.
